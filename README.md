# Justice Restaurative 
## Project Web P2 S2

Web pages developed for the French Institute of Restorative Justice website. 

One dedicated to individuals, so that they can find essential information on restorative justice
and find the contact details of the dedicated person in their department. For this, there's a clickable map of France, divided by department,
a search bar and a filtering tool for different measures. When you click on the map or search in the dedicated bar, the contact informations 
are displayed, as well as the availability of measures/programs. 

The other is a training area containing a training catalog and a page for each course. 
The latter contain information and details, as well as course dates and cities, and a contact form. 

You can also log in as admin, in which case most of the content becomes editable. 
You can also modify the availability of a measure on the map, or add training courses and dates.
